Data Structures & Algorithms
# Day-1 21-Dec-23
- Types of data structures
- Uses of linked listed
- In Music player Doubly linked list is used
- If Non stop play music  then circular linked list is used
- Uses of Graph
- Each Application of data of google is connected to each others
# Day-2 22-Dec-23
- Array
- 1 Traversal
- 2 Insert Element at 0th position
- Array just like DVD box. To add New DVD in box.
- Arrays are used in TV channels.We can easily access the channel by index. 
- Uses of Insert Element at 0th position:
- 1.Message Handling
- 2.Priority Queues
# Day-3 23-Dec-23
- 1 Insert Element at end/last position
- 2 Insert Element at specific position
# Day-4 28-Dec-23
- Deletion in Array
- 1 Delete Element at 0th position
- 2 Delete Element at end position
- 3 Delete Element at specific position
# Day-5 29-Dec-23
- Difference between Array and linked list
- 1 Singly linked list ðŸ”—
- 2 Doubly linked list ðŸ”—
# Day-6 1-jan-24
- Uses of linked list
- linked list use in You tube.
- Linked list is not regular  it stores data any place in memory
  because dynamic memory allocation.so Address is either increase or decrease order.
- We stores photos in gellery.
# Day-7 3-jan-24
- Circular Linked list
- Doubly Circular Linked list
- Create single node in singly linked list.
# Day-8 4-jan-24
- Introduction of Hashing
- Hash Table,Hashing Functions
- Collision Resolution Techniques
- 1.Chaining(open hashing)
- 2.Close hashing
- Linear probing,Quadratic probing
- Hashing is used to stores the password in data base
  means security of the password.
- Hash function is just like maths functions means logical functions.
- Hash table is just like Array. and values are known as keys.
# Day-9 5-jan-24
- Linked list Traversal
- Insert  node at 0th position in Linked list
# Day-10 19-jan-24
- Insert node at 0th position in linked list
- This program is used in
- Notification System
  In a notification system, new notifications can be inserted at the beginning of
  a linked list to ensure that users see the latest notifications first.
- Recent Activities:
  Applications that track recent activities (e.g., recent documents opened, recent searches) can insert
  new items at the beginning of the linked list to maintain a chronological order.
- Playlist Management:
  In a music or video playlist, new songs or videos can be added at the beginning
  of the linked list to play the most recently added content first.
# Day-11 20-jan-24
-  Insert  node at End  in Linked list.
